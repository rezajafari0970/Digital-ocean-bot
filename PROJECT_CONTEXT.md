# Project Context
This repository is the durable source of truth for the DigitalOcean + Vultr automation project. Chat history is not the sole project record.

## Core rules
- Keep provider integrations modular and independent.
- DigitalOcean and Vultr capacity/account logic uses provider-specific authoritative data.
- Sanaei/x-ui live reads/writes use its API where implemented; Output must not depend on SSH reads.
- Output is live/fast rather than stale cached data.
- Proxy/account/provider modules remain independently testable.
- CAPTCHA/2FA challenges are completed interactively; authorized sessions may then be reused where appropriate.

## Continuity protocol
Before ending a development session: update PROJECT_STATE.md and HANDOFF.md with branch/HEAD, tests, deploy state, migrations, blockers, and exact next action; commit and push. Never store passwords, API tokens, private keys, cookies, or session secrets in these documents.

At a new chat/session: read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_STATE.md, HANDOFF.md, then verify git status/HEAD and production service state before changing code.
